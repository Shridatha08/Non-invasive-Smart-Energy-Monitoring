Smart home devices and its applications have a great upside potential in successfully cutting
down the electricity consumption across households. This study focuses on the realisation of
the potential that the application provides. As an initial process, the current consumption is
measured and stored in a database with the help of PHP via the ESP32 microcontroller. The
AWS cloud services is used for the users to view consumption in real-time. Data acquired is
utilised by the server to run LSTM Neural Networks to predict the possible future usage. This
predicted future value is compared with the actual consumption to test the accuracy of the
model.
